This folder contains the slide and code samples from my
presentation on 9/12/2011 for Adobe ColdFusion Developer Week
entitled: "Working with PDFs Made Easy with ColdFusion." The target 
audience for this presentation was people new to ColdFusion or
people who have never worked with the CFDocument and CFPDF tags.

The slides out of context of the presentation may or may not make sense.
So you may want to view the recording of the presenation:
