iTextCFC is a ColdFusion Wrapper for the IText Java Library.  iText is used by 
Adobe ColdFusion in the CFDocument and CFPDF tags, however the Adobe Tags do not
do everything that iText can do.

The testArea code is ColdFusion examples of the Java examples from http://itextpdf.com/book/
Comments in the code should tell you what page of the book the example is taken from.

The final desired product of this project is a CFC that allows you to easily use all the functions of the
Itext Library.

Requirements: 

ColdFusion 9 and below use and older version of the iText Java Library. 
	1. Download latest jar from itextPDF.com
	2. Put the itext jar in the ColdFusion Class Path for instance: C:\Coldfusion9\lib\
		Your path may vary, just search for iText.jar and put the new jar in the same folder.
		Do not copy over or remote the existing iText.jar, as this will break CFDocument and CFPDF.
	3. Restart your ColdFusion Service
