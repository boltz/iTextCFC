iTextCFC is a ColdFusion Wrapper for the IText Java Library.  iText is used by 
Adobe ColdFusion in the CFDocument and CFPDF tags, however the Adobe Tags do not
do everything that iText can do.

Requirements: 

ColdFusion 9 and below use and older version of the iText Java Library. 
	1. Download latest jar from itextPDF.com
	2. Put the itext jar in the ColdFusion Class Path for instance: C:\Coldfusion9\lib\
		Your path may vary, just search for iText.jar and put the new jar in the same folder.
		Do not copy over or remote the existing iText.jar, as this will break CFDocument and CFPDF.
	3. Restart your ColdFusion Service
